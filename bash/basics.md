### Listing Directories

```bash
$ ls

Desktop/  Documents/  Downloads/  Music/  Pictures/  Public/  Templates/  Videos/

```
Whoa! You got a list of directories inside /home/<username>/ (Or you $HOME env variable)!
`ls` stands for **L**i**s**t Directories.


You can list files in a directory using `ls <directory name>`. It defaults to `ls <your/home/path>`, so that's why you see the contents of your home folder.

```bash
$ ls Documents

afile.txt 'Copy of Untitled Document.pdf'  wiki/
```

### Changing Directories
Listing directories may be cool, but once you go into them you can do a lot more cool stuff.
```bash
$ cd Downloads
```

It is that simple.


If you want to go to the directory above, you can use `cd ..`. 

In Unix, `..` means the above directory.

If you ever need to go to the $HOME or your home folder, and you need to do it quick, you can plainly just use `cd` and it will by default transport you there.
